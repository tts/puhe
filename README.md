# puhe

A POC type of Shiny app that demonstrates how to 

* search [Parlamenttisampo](https://parlamenttisampo.fi/fi) with a SPARQL query
* make use of the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/): extract keywords from the speech, and make an image based on these keywords.

Note that the app consumes tokens from a trial account of the OpenAI API, due to expire 1 May 2023. As of writing this, most of the $18 credit granted is still available.
